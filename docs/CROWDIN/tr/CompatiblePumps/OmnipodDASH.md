# Omnipod DASH

These instructions are for configuring the **Omnipod DASH** generation pump **(NOT Omnipod Eros)**, available in **AAPS** from version 3.0.

## Omnipod DASH özellikleri

These are the specifications of the **Omnipod DASH** ('DASH') and what differentiates it from the **Omnipod EROS** ('EROS'):

- The DASH pods are identified by a **blue needle cap** (EROS has a clear needle cap). The pods are otherwise identical in terms of physical dimensions.
- DASH does not require a BLE link/bridge device (NO RileyLink, OrangeLink, or EmaLink needed).
- The DASH's Bluetooth connection is used only when sending a command (e.g a Bolus), and disconnects right after issuing the command.
- No more "no connection to link device / pod" errors with DASH.
- **AAPS** will wait for pod's accessibility to send commands.
- On pod activation, **AAPS** will find and connect to a new DASH pod.
- Expected range from phone: 5-10 meters (YMMV).

## Omnipod DASH known AAPS constraints/issues
- Android 16 requires **AAPS** version 3.3.2.1 or later.
- General advice is to run **AAPS** on Android 14 or 16. Android 15 has many reported [issues](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS/issues/3471) from the community. However, if you do run on Android 15 you will likely need to enable Bluetooth Bonding to successfully activate and use Pods, see [General Troubleshooting](../GettingHelp/GeneralTroubleshooting.md) for more info on the Bonding settings.
- Too frequent basal updates may cause basal insulin delivery [problems](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS/issues/4158) with Omnipod Dash. When using **SMB**, limit the interval to 5 minutes minimum to avoid this issue.
- Dash only supports basal rate in 0.05 U/h steps. If you try to set basal with 0.01 steps in your **AAPS profile**, AAPS will not give a warning even though the pod will round up the rate into 0.05 steps. If you view POD MGMT/Pod History it will display that 0.05 basal was set. This also means the lowest basal rate allowed by the DASH in **AAPS** is 0.05U/h.
- The activation status of a Pod is stored in the settings file, if you export a settings file with an active pod. Then change to a new pod, then restore the settings from your previous export you will have now restored the old pod activation and removed the new pod activation. This is why we recommend to export settings after each pod activation to allow a restore of that pods activation state if something happens to your rig.
- When setting a new basal profile, DASH will suspend delivery before setting the new basal **Profile**. If there is a communication interruption or error, the basal profile won't automatically re-start. See section [Resuming Insulin Delivery](#omnipod-dash-resuming-insulin-delivery) for details.
- If alerts are configured, and the pod is about to expire, the pod will keep beeping until alerts are silenced, see [Silencing Pod Alerts](#omnipod-dash-silencing-pod-alerts) for details.
- There are a number of known issues with Bluetooth which can cause pod activation problems. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for advice on Bluetooth issues, specifically the [Bluetooth related issues](#omnipod-dash-bluetooth-related-issues) section.

## Donanım/Yazılım Gereksinimleri

- Omnipod DASH is identified by the blue needle cap.

![Omnipod Pod](../images/DASH_images/Omnipod_Pod.png)

- **A Compatible Android phone** with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) (see [Phones](../Getting-Started/Phones.md) for more info), additionally the following information will help guide you on other key considerations around successfully activating and using the DASH on a compatible phone:
    -  The **AAPS** Omnipod Dash driver connects with the DASH Pod using Bluetooth.  
      **AAPS** will automatically establish a new Bluetooth connection to the Pod every time it needs to send a command (e.g a Bolus), after sending the command the Bluetooth connection is immediately disconnected.
       - **NOT:**
         - The Bluetooth connection can be interrupted/disturbed by other Bluetooth devices linked to the phone that is running **AAPS**, like earbuds etc... Devices like this can cause connection errors or pod activation issues on some models of phones. It's a good idea to review the [tested hardware setups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vScCNaIguEZVTVFAgpv1kXHdsHl3fs6xT6RB2Z1CeVJ561AvvqGwxMhlmSHk4J056gMCAQE02sAWJvT/pubhtml?gid=683363241&single=true) list for known working configurations before committing to a new rig built around Omnipod DASH.
         - There are a number of known issues with Bluetooth which can cause pod activation problems (See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for advice on other Bluetooth issues) specifically the [Bluetooth related issues](#omnipod-dash-bluetooth-related-issues) section.
    - For **Android 15** or below: You **MUST** use **Version 3.0 or newer of AAPS** using the [**Build APK**](../SettingUpAaps/BuildingAaps.md) instructions, however it's advisable to run the latest released version.
    - For **Android 16**: you **MUST** use **Version 3.3.2.1 or newer of AAPS** using the [**Build APK**](../SettingUpAaps/BuildingAaps.md) instructions, due to Android 16 changing how its Bluetooth works. Any version earlier than 3.3.2.1 will likely cause pod failures and/or activation [issues](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS/issues/3471).
- A supported [**Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)**](../Getting-Started/CompatiblesCgms.md)

The instructions below explain how to activate a new pod session using **AAPS**. You should wait for your current Pod to be close expiry, as you will need to activate a new Pod with **AAPS**. Once a pod is de-activated it cannot be reused/re-activated, the de-activation is final.

## Başlamadan önce

Ensure you have read and understand this whole guide, have read and understand the **Before You Begin** section, as well as  **[Omnipod and AAPS Constraints and Issues](#omnipod-dash-constraints)** to avoid running into a known problem.

#### **SAFETY FIRST** - You **SHOULD NOT** try to connect **AAPS** to a pod for the first time without having access to all of the following:
1. Extra pods (3 or more spare)
2. Spare Insulin and MDI equipment
3. A working Omnipod PDM (In case **AAPS** fails)
4. Supported Phones are a must! (See [Hardware/Software Requirements](#hardware-software-requirements))
5. Correct version of AAPS built and installed

#### **Your Omnipod Dash PDM will become redundant after the AAPS Dash driver activates your pod.**
- Before using **AAPS** you or your care giver would have had to manage the Pod using the Omnipod PDM (or in some regions a Phone app) to send commands to your DASH (e.g a Bolus).
- The DASH can only facilitate a single Bluetooth device (e.g PDM or Phone) connection to manage and send commands.
- The device that successfully activates the pod is the only device allowed to communicate with that Pod from that point forward. This means that once you activate a DASH with your Android phone using **AAPS**, **you will no longer be able to use your PDM with that pod!** For the time that Pod is active the **AAPS** Dash driver running on your Android phone is now the new PDM for your pod.
- **DO NOT Throw away your PDM!** It is recommended to keep it around as a backup and for emergencies, for instance when your phone gets lost or **AAPS** is not working correctly.

#### Your pod **WILL NOT** stop delivering insulin when it is not connected to AAPS.
Default basal rates are programmed on the pod on activation as defined in the current active [**Profile**](../SettingUpAaps/YourAapsProfile.md).  
As long as **AAPS** is operational it will send basal rate adjustment commands that run for a maximum of 120 minutes.  
When for some reason the pod does not receive any new commands (for instance because communication was lost due to Pod ➜ phone distance) the pod will automatically fall back to default basal rates as defined in your [**Profile**](../SettingUpAaps/YourAapsProfile.md).

#### **AAPS Profile(s) do not support 30 minute basal rate time frames**
If you are new to **AAPS** and are setting up your basal rate [**Profile**](../SettingUpAaps/YourAapsProfile.md) for the first time, please be aware that basal rates starting on a half-hour basis are not supported. For example, on your Omnipod PDM, if you have a basal rate of 1.1 units which starts at 09:30 and has a duration of 2 hours ending at 11:30, it is not possible replicate this exact basil **Profile** in **AAPS**.  
You will need to change this 1.1 unit basal rate to a time range of either 9:00-11:00 or 10:00-12:00. Even though the DASH hardware itself supports the 30 minute basal rate **Profile** increments, **AAPS** does NOT support this feature.

#### **0U/h Profile basal rates are NOT supported in AAPS**
While the DASH does support a zero basal rate, **AAPS** uses multiples of the user's **Profile** basal rate to determine automated treatment; it cannot function with a zero basal rate.  
Instead a temporary zero basal rate can be achieved through the "Disconnect pump" function, or through a combination of Disable Loop/Temp Basal Rate or Suspend Loop/Temp Basal Rate.  
**NOTE:** The lowest basal rate allowed by the DASH in **AAPS** is 0.05U/h.

## Selecting Dash in AAPS

There are **two** available options to configure Omnipod in **AAPS**:

### Seçenek 1: Yeni kurulum

When installing **AAPS** for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide new users through key features and installation requirements for **AAPS**.  
Select “DASH” when you reach Pump selection.

![Enable_Dash_1](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_1.png)

When in doubt you can also select “Virtual Pump” and select “DASH” later, after setting up **AAPS** (See Option 2).

(omnipod-dash-option-2-config-builder)=
### Seçenek 2: Konfigürasyon ayarları

On an existing installation you can select the **DASH** pump from the Config builder:

On the top-left hand corner **hamburger menu** select **Config Builder (1)** ➜ **Pump** ➜ **Dash** ➜ **Settings Gear (3)** by selecting the **radio button (2)** titled **Dash**.

Selecting the **checkbox (4)** next to the **Settings Gear (3)** will allow the DASH menu to be displayed as a tab in the **AAPS** interface titled **DASH**. Checking this box will facilitate your access to the DASH commands when using **AAPS**.

**NOTE:** A faster way to access the [**Dash settings**](#omnipod-dash-settings) can be found below in the DASH settings section of this document.

![Enable_Dash_3](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_3.png)

### Omnipod Sürücü Seçiminin Doğrulanması

To verify that you have selected the DASH in **AAPS**, if you have **checked the box (4)**, **swipe to the left** from the **Overview** tab, where you will now see a **DASH** tab on **AAPS**. If this box is left unchecked, you’ll find the DASH tab in the hamburger menu upper left.

![Enable_Dash_4](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_4.jpg)

## Dash Konfigürasyonu

**Swipe left** to the [**DASH tab**](#omnipod-dash-tab) where you will be able to manage all pod functions (some of these functions are not enabled or visible without an active pod session):

   ![Activate_Pod_1](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_1.png)

   ![Activate_Pod_2](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_2.png)

2. **Podu Doldur** ekranı görüntülenir. Fill a new pod with **at least 80 units** of insulin and listen for two beeps indicating that the pod is ready to be primed.

   ***NOTE:** When calculating the total amount of insulin you need for 3 days, please take into account that priming the pod will use about 3-10 units.*

   ![Activate_Pod_3](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_3.png)

   ![Activate_Pod_4](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_4.jpg)

   Ensure that the new pod and the phone running **AAPS** are within close proximity of each other and click the **Next** button.

   ***NOTE**: if the  error message below pops up _'Could not find an available pod for activation'_ (this can happen), do not panic. Click on the **Retry** button. In most situations activation will continue successfully.*

   ![Activate_Pod_3](../images/DASH_images/Activate_pod_error.png)

3. On the **Initialize Pod** screen, the pod will begin priming (you will hear a click followed by a series of ticking sounds as the pod primes itself).  
   A green checkmark will be shown upon successful priming, and the **Next** button will become enabled. Pod hazırlama işlemini tamamlamak ve **Pod Ekle** ekranını görüntülemek için **İleri** butonunu tıklayın.

   ![Activate_Pod_5](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_5.jpg)    ![Activate_Pod_6](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_6.jpg)

4. Next, prepare the infusion site ready to receive the new pod. Wash hands to avoid any risk of infection. Clean the infusion site by either using soap and water or an alcohol wipe to disinfect and let the skin air dry completely before proceeding.   
   If you get skin irritation from the adhesive consider using a Barrier Wipe or Barrier Spray.

   Remove the pod's blue plastic needle cap. If you see something that sticks out of the pod or it looks unusual, **STOP** the process and start with a new pod. If everything looks **OK**, proceed to take off the white paper backing from the adhesive and stick the pod to the selected site on your body.

   Bitirdiğinizde, **İleri** butonunu tıklayın.

   ![Activate_Pod_8](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_8.jpg)

6. **Pod Ekle** iletişim kutusu şimdi görünecektir. **click on the OK button ONLY if you are ready to deploy the cannula!**

   ![Activate_Pod_9](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_9.jpg)

7. After pressing **OK**, it may take some time before the DASH responds and inserts the cannula (1-2 minutes maximum). **Be patient!**

   ***NOTE:** Before the cannula is inserted, it is good practice to pinch the skin near the cannula insertion point. Bu iğnenin düzgün bir şekilde yerleştirilmesini sağlar ve tıkanıklık oluşturma şansınızı azaltır.*

   ![Activate_Pod_10](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_10.png)    ![Activate_Pod_11](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_11.jpg)

   Devre dışı bırakmanın başarılı olduğuna dair poddan bir onay bip sesi alacaksınız.

   ![Deactivate_Pod_3](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_3.jpg)

   ![Deactivate_Pod_4](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_4.jpg)

3. A green checkmark will be displayed upon successful deactivation. Pod devre dışı ekranını görüntülemek için **İleri** butonunu tıklayın.

   Etkin oturum devre dışı bırakıldığı için artık podunuzu çıkartabilirsiniz.

   ![Deactivate_Pod_5](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_5.jpg)

4. **Pod Yönetimi** ekranına dönmek için yeşil butona tıklayın.

   ![Deactivate_Pod_6](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_6.jpg)

5. Artık **Pod Yönetimi** menüsündesiniz; **DASH** sekmesine dönmek için telefonunuzdaki geri butonuna basın.

   **Pod durumu:** alanında bir **Aktif pod yok** mesajının görüntülendiğini doğrulayın.

   ![Deactivate_Pod_2](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_2.png)

   ![Deactivate_Pod_8](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_4.jpg)


(omnipod-dash-resuming-insulin-delivery)=

### İnsülin İletimini Sürdür

**NOTE**: During **Profile Switches**, like when using the PDM, AAPS must suspend delivery on the Pod before setting the new basal **Profile**. If communication fails between the suspend and resume commands, then delivery can stay suspended, Read [**Delivery suspended**](#omnipod-dash-delivery-suspended) in the troubleshooting section for more details.

When insulin delivery is suspended you will need to issue a command to instruct the active, currently suspended pod to resume insulin delivery. After the command is successfully processed, insulin will resume normal delivery using the current basal rate based on the current time from the active basal **Profile**. The pod will again accept commands for bolus, **TBR**, and **SMB**.

1. **DASH** sekmesine gidin ve **Pod durumu (1)** satırında **ASKIYA ALINDI** mesajının görünmesi gerekir, ardından mevcut podun normal insülin iletimini sürdürmesi talimatını vermek için **İLETİME DEVAM ET (2)** butonuna basın. **Pod Durumu (3)** satırında **İleme Devam Et** mesajı görüntülenir.

   ![Resume_1](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_1.jpg)   ![Resume_2](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_2.jpg)

2. İletimi sürdür komutu başarılı olduğunda, bir onay iletişim kutusu **İnsülin iletimi yeniden başlatıldı.** mesajını görüntüler. Onaylamak ve devam etmek için **Tamam**'ı tıklayın.

   ![Resume_3](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_3.png)

3. **DASH** sekmesi, **Pod durumu (1)** satırını **ÇALIŞIYOR** olarak günceller ve **İletime Devam Et** butonu artık görüntülenmez.

   ![Resume_4](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_4.jpg)

(omnipod-dash-silencing-pod-alerts)=

### Pod Alarmlarını Susturma

The process below will show you how to acknowledge and dismiss pod beeps when the active pod time reaches the warning time limit before the pod expiration of 72 hours (3 days). This warning time limit is defined in the **Hours before shutdown** Dash alerts setting. The maximum life of a pod is 80 hours (3 days 8 hours), however Insulet recommends not exceeding the 72 hours (3 days) limit.

***NOTE**: The **SILENCE ALERTS (3)** button is only available on the **DASH** tab when the pod expiration or low reservoir alert has been triggered. If the **SILENCE ALERTS** button is not visible and you hear beep sounds from the pod, try to 'Refresh pod status'.*

1. When the defined **Hours before shutdown** warning time limit is reached, the pod will issue warning beeps to inform you that it is approaching its expiration time and a pod change will be required soon.  
   You can verify this on the **DASH** tab, the **Pod expires: (1)** field will show the exact time the pod will expire (72 hours after activation), and the text will turn **red** after this time has passed.  
   Under the **Active Pod alerts (2)** field the status message **Pod will expire soon** is displayed. Bu aynı zamanda **ALARMLARI SUSTUR (3)** butonunun görüntülenmesini de tetikler.

   ![ACK_alerts_1](../images/DASH_images/ACK_Alerts/ACK_ALERTS_1.png)

2. Go to the **DASH** tab and press the **SILENCE ALERTS (2)** button. **AAPS** sends the command to the pod to deactivate the pod expiration warning beeps and updates the **Pod status (1)** field with **ACKNOWLEDGE ALERTS**.

   ![ACK_alerts_2](../images/DASH_images/ACK_Alerts/ACK_ALERTS_2.png)

3. Uyarıların **başarıyla devre dışı bırakılması** üzerine, etkin pod tarafından **2 bip** sesi verilir ve bir onay iletişim kutusunda **Etkin alarmlar susturuldu.** mesajı görüntülenir. İletişim kutusunu onaylamak ve kapatmak için **Tamam** butonunu tıklayın.

   ![ACK_alerts_3](../images/DASH_images/ACK_Alerts/ACK_ALERTS_3.png)

4. **DASH** sekmesine gidin. **Etkin Pod Alarmları** satırında, uyarı mesajı artık görüntülenmez ve etkin pod artık sona erme uyarısı bip sesi vermez.

(omnipod-dash-view-pod-history)=

### Pod Geçmişini Görüntüle

This section explains how to review your active pod history and filter by different action categories. The pod history tool allows you to view the actions and results committed to your currently active pod during its three days (72 - 80 hours) life.

This feature is helpful in verifying boluses, TBRs and basal commands that were sent to the pod. The remaining categories are useful for troubleshooting issues and determining the order of events that occurred leading up to a failure.

***NOTE:** **Only the last command can be uncertain**. New commands *will not be sent* until the **last 'uncertain' command becomes 'confirmed' or 'denied'**. The way to 'fix' uncertain commands is to **'refresh pod status'**.*

1. **DASH** sekmesine gidin ve **POD YNTM (1)** butonuna basarak **Pod Yönetimi** menüsüne gidin ve ardından pod geçmişi ekranına erişmek için **Pod geçmişi (2)** butonuna basın.

![Dash_settings_1](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_3.png)

***NOTE:** A faster way to access the **Dash settings** is by accessing the **3 dot menu (1)** in the upper right hand corner of the **DASH** tab and selecting **Dash preferences (2)** from the dropdown menu.*

![Dash_settings_3](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_3.png)

The settings groups are listed below; you can enable or disable via a toggle switch for most entries described below:

***NOTE:** An asterisk (\*) denotes the default setting is enabled.*

### Onay Bildirimleri

![Dash_settings_4](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_4.jpg)

Provides confirmation beeps from the pod for bolus, basal, SMB, and TBR delivery and changes.

**Bolus beeps enabled:**    Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a bolus is delivered.

**Basal beeps enabled:**    Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a new basal rate is set, active basal rate is canceled or current basal rate is changed.

**SMB beeps enabled:**  Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a SMB is delivered.

**TBR beeps enabled:**  Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a TBR is set or canceled.



### Alarmlar

![Dash_settings_5](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_5.jpg)

Provides **AAPS** alerts for pod expiration, shutdown, low reservoir based on the defined threshold units.

***NOTE:** an AAPS notification will ALWAYS be issued for any alert after the initial communication with the pod since the alert was triggered. Dismissing the notification will NOT dismiss the alert UNLESS automatically acknowledge Pod alerts is enabled. To MANUALLY dismiss the alert you must visit the **DASH** tab and press the **Silence ALERTS button**.*

**Expiration reminder enabled:**    Enable or disable the pod expiration reminder set to trigger when the defined number of hours before shutdown is reached.

**Hours before shutdown:**  Defines the number hours before the active pod shutdown occurs, which will then trigger the expiration reminder alert.

**Low reservoir alert enabled:**    Enable or disable an alert when the pod's remaining units low reservoir limit is reached as defined in the Number of units field.

**Number of units:**    The number of units at which to trigger the pod low reservoir alert.



### Bildirimler

![Dash_settings_6](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_6.jpg)

The Notification section allows the user to select their preferred notifications and audible phone alerts when AAPS is uncertain about the status of TBR, SMB, or bolus, and when delivery suspended events were successful.

***NOTE:** These are notifications only, no audible beep alerts are made.*

**Sound for uncertain TBR notifications enabled:**  Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when **AAPS** is uncertain if a TBR was successfully set.

**Sound for uncertain SMB notifications enabled:**  Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when **AAPS** is uncertain if an SMB was successfully delivered.

**Sound for uncertain bolus notifications enabled:**    Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when **AAPS** is uncertain if a bolus was successfully delivered.

**Sound when delivery suspended notifications enabled:**    Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when suspend delivery was successfully delivered.

## Eylemler (EYLEM) Sekmesi

This tab is well documented in the main **AAPS** documentation but there are a few items on this tab that are specific to how the DASH differs from tube based pumps, especially after the processes of applying a new pod.

1. Go to the **Actions (ACT)** tab in the main **AAPS** interface.

2. Under the **Careportal (1)** section the **Insulin** and **Cannula** fields will have their **age reset** to 0 days and 0 hours **after each pod change**. Bu Omnipod pompasının çalışma şekli nedeniyle böyle yapılmaktadır. Pod, kanülü doğrudan pod uygulama bölgesinde deriye yerleştirdiği için, Omnipod pompalarında hortum kullanılmaz. *Bu nedenle, bir pod değişikliğinden sonra bu değerlerin her birinin yaşı otomatik olarak sıfırlanır.* **Pompa pil yaşı** pod pili her zaman kendi ömründen daha fazla olacağı için (maksimum 80 saat) rapor edilmez. **Pompa pili** ve **insülin rezervuarı**, her pod içinde yer almaktadır.

   ![ACT_1](../images/DASH_images/Actions_Tab/ACT_1.png)

### Seviye

**Insulin Level**

Insulin level displayed is the amount reported by DASH. However, the pod only reports the actual insulin reservoir level when it is below 50 units. Until then “Above 50 units” will be displayed. The amount reported is not exact: when the pod reports ‘empty’ in most cases the reservoir will still have some additional units of insulin left.

The DASH overview tab will display as described the below:

  * **Above 50 Units** - The pod reports more than 50 units currently in the reservoir.
  * **50 Ünitenin Altında** - Pod tarafından bildirilen rezervuarda kalan insülin miktarı.

Additional note:
  * **SMS** - SMS yanıtlarında insülin seviyesi 50+Ü veya değer görünür.
  * **Nightscout** - Nightscout'a (sürüm 14.07 ve daha eski) 50 üniteden fazla olduğunda 50 değerini yükler.  Daha yeni sürümler, 50 ünite üzerinde olduğunda 50+ değerini bildirir.

## Troubleshooting

(omnipod-dash-delivery-suspended)=

This section covers common known issues and solutions for Omnipod DASH use with AAPS. There is also [General Troubleshooting](../GettingHelp/GeneralTroubleshooting.md) section in the documentation that should be reviewed as it covers relevant topics for some Pod issues too.

(omnipod-dash-bluetooth-related-issues)=

### Bluetooth related issues

Some members of the community have been running into issues with Pod activation failures and other pod errors related to Bluetooth. Many of these issues can be traced to one of the following issues:

#### **Android 16**

- Android 16 needs at a minimum **AAPS** version 3.3.2.1, as this versions has fixes added to specifically address [known problems](../GettingHelp/GeneralTroubleshooting.md#cannot-start-omnipod-with-android-16) introduced in Android 16 for Omnipod.

#### **Apps that use the "Nearby devices" Android permission**

Android allows you to control what each app is able to do or access on your phone via a permission model. For each app installed you can choose to allow or deny specific permissions, e.g. access files on the device, access to bluetooth, scan for nearby devices etc.

**AAPS** requires a number of specific permission to function, one which is required ensure that Pods work is the "Nearby devices" permission. There are many other applications which also require this permission, the community is finding that a number of applications when they are granted this permission can cause issues with activating new Pods on some devices.

#### **Apps that use "Nearby device" permissions and are known to have caused problems:**

Apps in this list have been discussed in one or more places in the community as causing problems for Omnipod DASH devices. Any advice and links to the information found will be in this table.

***NOTE:** If you wish to update any info in this table please ping @XiTatiON on #omnipod-dash Discord channel.*

**myBMW**   MyBMW interrupted Medtrum Nano and Omnipod DASH. The MyBMW app prompts regarding permission for "find nearby devices" only once, if you don't grant it, it still works absolutely OK

**Amazon Alexa**    Removing "Nearby devices" for Alexa app resolved problem for some people but will break the ability to pair Matter IOT devices

**MINI app**    Appears the app is based on myBMW app and might mirror it's behavior as a result



#### **How to revoke "Nearby device" permissions for other apps:**
If you are facing issues activating a new Pod and you are running on the correct supported version of **AAPS** for your version of Android. It may be necessary to revoked the permission for other apps while activating a new Pod.

Follow this procedure to revoked the "Nearby device" permission for all apps except **AAPS**:

***NOTE:** The screenshots and instructions in this guide are from a Vanilla Android 16 install on Google Pixel 8 Pro. Other manufactures and devices will likely not exactly match these menus and settings descriptions, adjust the steps to suit the device you have and if you are stuck see [Where to get help for dash](#omnipod-dash-where-to-get-help-for-dash) section on how to reach out to the community for support.*

1. Open Android settings on your phone, scroll down and press on **Security and privacy (1)**.

    ![android_settings_sec_priv](../images/android_16/android_settings_sec_priv.png)

2. Scroll down and press on **Privacy controls (1)**.

   ![android_sec_priv](../images/android_16/android_sec_priv.png)

3. Press on **Permission manager (1)**.

   ![android_priv_control](../images/android_16/android_priv_control.png)

3. Scroll down and press on **Nearby devices (1)**.

   ![android_perm_man_nearby_dev](../images/android_16/android_perm_man_nearby_dev.png)

4. Browse the list of apps and press on the app you wish to revoke **Nearby devices** permissions for.

   In this guide **Android Auto (1)** is the app we will revoke the permission on.

   To avoid bricking more pods we advise everyone initially to revoke the permission on all apps except **AAPS**.

   ***NOTE:** If you are unsure which app is causing you an issue, disable them all (remember to check the list of known problem apps too and start with those) and if you can spare a few bricked pods on the way, enable the permission on one new app before every new Pod activation, until you can narrow down which app specifically causes your Pod issues. If you do identify new problematic apps please let us know on the #omnipod-dash Discord channel.*

   ![android_nearby_dev](../images/android_16/android_nearby_dev.png)

5. To revoke the permission Press on **Don't allow (1)**, then Press on **Don't allow anyway (2)**. If done correctly you should see **Don't allow (3)** as the selected Toggle option. You can now go back to the **Nearby device** menu by pressing the **Back arrow (4)** and change this setting on other apps if required.

   ![android_auto_nearby_dev](../images/android_16/android_auto_nearby_dev.png) ![android_auto_nearby_dev](../images/android_16/android_auto_nearby_dont_allow_anyway.png)  ![android_auto_nearby_dev](../images/android_16/android_auto_nearby_dont_allow.png)

#### **How to re-enable "Nearby device" permissions for system apps and other apps:**

1. If required Reference the **"How to revoke "Nearby device" permissions for other apps"** section on how to get to the app privacy settings, then once in the **Nearby device** configuration proceed to 2.

2. Browse the list of apps and press on the app you wish to allow **Nearby devices** permissions for.

   In this guide **Android Auto (1)** is the app we will allow the permission on.

   You will notice that **Android Auto (1)** is missing in the app list after the permission is revoked. This is because the **Android Auto** app is a **System app** and by default system apps are hidden.

   ![android_auto_nearby_dev_missing](../images/android_16/android_auto_nearby_dev_missing.png)

3. To show hidden system apps Press on the **Three Dotted Lines (Hamburger) (1)**, then Press on **"Show System (1)"**. You should now be able to see the hidden system app in the list **Android Auto (3)**.

   ***NOTE:** If an app is revoked you will need to scroll down until you see the list of revoked apps lower down in the list.*

   ![android_auto_nearby_dev_missing_hamburger](../images/android_16/android_auto_nearby_dev_missing_hamburger.png) ![android_auto_nearby_show_system](../images/android_16/android_auto_nearby_show_system.png) ![android_nearby_dev_system](../images/android_16/android_nearby_dev_system.png)

5. Follow the guidance in **"How to revoke "Nearby device" permissions for other apps"** in reverse to re-enable permissions for each app.

### İletimi askıya alma

  - Artık iletimi askıya alma butonu yok. If you want to "suspend" the pod, you can set a zero **TBR** for x minutes.
  - During **Profile Switches**, DASH must suspend delivery before setting the new basal **Profile**. İki komut arasında iletişim başarısız olursa, iletim askıya alınabilir. Bu olduğunda:
     - Bazal, SMB, Manuel bolus vb. içeren insülin iletimi olmayacaktır.
     - Komutlardan birinin onaylanmadığına dair bir bildirim olabilir: bu, hatanın ne zaman gerçekleştiğine bağlıdır.
     - **AAPS** will try to set the new basal profile every 15 minutes.
     - **AAPS** will show a notification informing that the delivery is suspended every 15 minutes, if the delivery is still suspended (resume delivery failed).
     - The [**Resume delivery**](#omnipod-dash-resuming-insulin-delivery) button will be active if the user chooses to resume delivery manually.
     - If **AAPS** fails to resume delivery on its own (this happens if the pod is unreachable, sound is muted, etc), the pod will start beeping 4 times every minute for 3 minutes, then repeated every 15 minutes if delivery is still suspended for more than 20 minutes.
  - Onaylanmamış komutlar için "pod durumunu yenile" komutu, bunları onaylamalı/reddetmelidir.

*****NOTE:** When you hear beeps from the pod, do not assume that delivery will continue without checking the phone, delivery might stay suspended, ***so you need to check !******

---
### Pod Hataları

- Pods fail occasionally due to a variety of issues, including hardware issues with the Pod itself.
- It is best practice not to raise support / replacement cases with Insulet, since AAPS is not an approved method of using the Pods.
- A list of fault codes can be [**found here**](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Fault-event-codes) to help determine the cause.

---
### 49 numaralı Pod hatasını önleme

This failure is related to an incorrect pod state for a command or an error during an insulin delivery command. This is when the driver and Pod disagree on the actual state. The Pod (out of a built-in safety measure) then reacts with an unrecoverable error code 49 (0x31) ending up with what is know as a “screamer”: the long irritating beep that can only be stopped by punching a hole at the appropriate location at the back of the Pod. The exact origin of a “49 pod failure” often is hard to trace. In situations that are suspected for this failure to occur (for instance on application crashes, running a development version or re-installation).

---

### Pompaya Ulaşılamıyor Uyarıları

When no communication can be established with the pod for a pre-configured time a “Pump unreachable” alert will be raised. Pump unreachable alerts can be configured by going to the top right-hand side three-dot menu, selecting **Preferences** ➜ **Local Alerts** ➜ **Pump unreachable threshold [min]**. Recommended value is alerting after **120** minutes.

---
### Ayarları Dışa Aktarma

Exporting **AAPS** settings enables you to restore all your settings, and maybe more importantly, all your Objectives. You may need to restore settings to the “last known working situation” or after uninstalling/reinstalling **AAPS** or in case of phone loss, reinstalling on the new phone.

***NOTE:** The active pod information is included in the exported settings. If you import an "old" exported file, your actual pod will "die". There is no other alternative. In some cases (like a _programmed_ phone change), you may need to use the exported file to restore **AAPS'** settings **while keeping the current active Pod**. In this case it is important to only use the recently exported settings file containing the pod currently active.*

**It is good practice to do an export immediately after activating a pod**. This way you will always be able to restore the current active pod in case of a problem. For instance when moving to another backup phone.

Regularly (after each export preferably) copy your exported settings to a safe place (a cloud drive e.g. Google Drive) that is accessible by any phone when needed. This allows you to restore to a phone from anywhere in case of a phone loss or factory reset of your phone while you are not at home.

---
### Ayarları İçe Aktarma

**WARNING**: Please note that importing settings will possibly import an outdated Pod status (depending when you made the last export/backup).  
As a result, there is a **risk of losing the active Pod!** (see **Exporting Settings**).
1. Only try an import when no other options are available.
2. When importing settings with an active Pod, make sure the export was done with the currently active pod.

**Importing while on an active Pod:** (you risk losing the Pod!)

1. **Make sure you are importing settings that were recently exported with the currently active Pod!**
2. Ayarlarınızı içe aktarın.
3. Tüm tercihleri kontrol edin.

**Importing (no active Pod session)**

1. Yakın zamanda dışa aktarılan bir dosyanın içe aktarılması işe yarayacaktır (yukarıya bakın)
2. Ayarlarınızı içe aktarın.
3. Tüm tercihleri kontrol edin.
4. You may need to **Deactivate** the "non existing" pod if the imported settings included any active pod data.

---
### Etkin olmayan bir pod durumunu içeren ayarları içe aktarma

When importing settings containing data for a Pod that is no longer active, AAPS will try to connect with it, which will obviously fail. You can not activate a new Pod in this situation.

To remove the old pod session:
1. “try” to de-activate the Pod. The de-activation will likely fail.
2. Select “Retry”.
3. After the second or third retry you will get the option to remove the pod.
4. Once the old pod is removed you will be able to activate a new pod.

---
### AAPS'i yeniden yükleme

When uninstalling **AAPS** you will lose all your settings, objectives and the current Pod session. **To restore them make sure you have a recent exported settings file available!**

When on an active Pod, make sure that you have an export for the current pod session or you will lose the currently active pod when importing older settings.

1. Export your settings and store a copy in a safe place (e.g Google Drive).
2. Uninstall **AAPS** and restart your phone.
3. Install the new version of **AAPS**.
4. Ayarlarınızı içe aktarın.
5. Verify all preferences (optionally import settings again).
6. Activate a new pod.
7. Tamamlandığında, mevcut ayarları dışa aktarın.

---
### AAPS'i daha yeni bir sürüme güncelleme

In most cases there is no need to uninstall. You can do an “in-place” install by starting the installation for the new version. This is also possible when on an active Pod session.

1. Ayarlarınızı dışa aktarın.
2. Install the new **AAPS** version.
3. Kurulumun başarılı olduğunu doğrulayın
4. RESUME the Pod or activate a new pod.
5. Tamamlandığında, mevcut ayarları dışa aktarın.

### Omnipod sürücü uyarıları

The Omnipod Dash driver presents a variety of unique alerts on the **Overview tab**, most of them are informational and can be dismissed while some provide the user with an action requiring their input to resolve the cause of the triggered alert.

A summary of the main alerts that you may encounter is listed below:

- Aktif bir Pod oturumu algılanamadı. Bu uyarı, **ERTELE**'ye basılarak geçici olarak kapatılabilir, ancak yeni bir pod etkinleştirilmedikçe tetiklenmeye devam edecektir. Etkinleştirildiğinde bu uyarı otomatik olarak susacaktır.
- Pod suspended Informational alert that pod has been suspended.
- Setting basal **Profile** failed : Delivery might be suspended! Lütfen Omnipod sekmesindeki Pod durumunu manuel olarak güncelleyin ve gerekirse teslimi devam ettirin.. Informational alert that the Pod basal **Profile** setting has failed, and you will need to hit *Refresh* on the Omnipod tab.
- Unable to verify whether **SMB** bolus succeeded. Bolus'un başarılı olmadığından eminseniz, SMB girişini Tedaviler'den manuel olarak kaldırmalısınız. Alert that the **SMB** bolus command success could not be verified, you will need to verify the *Last bolus* field on the DASH tab to see if **SMB** bolus succeeded and if not remove the entry from the Treatments tab.
- "Görev bolus/GBO/SMB"nin tamamlanıp tamamlanmadığı belirsizse, lütfen başarılı olup olmadığını manuel olarak doğrulayın.
